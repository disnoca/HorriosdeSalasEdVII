# HorriosdeSalasEdVII
This project is an app that serves as a tool for checking whether there is any rooms available for studying. \
It is especially made for NOVA School of Science and Technology (FCT NOVA) students but you may edit it as you wish.

It indicates which classrooms in Ed.VII currently not holding classes, meaning they are available for studying, and for how long. \
It also indicates which classrooms are currently holding classes, how long until they're over, and how long they will stay unused after its classes are over.
